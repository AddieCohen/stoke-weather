Understanding heloooos and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about heloooos.

A heloooo is {add a high-level description of Components are and their role in the system}.

Some examples of heloooos are:

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of {Example Component (an instance of Component)} for this example.

{add a high-level description of Example Component}.

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from {base class} in {add a "/path" of a containing folder, and / or describe the file naming convention}
    
2.  Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}
    
3.  Implement {add names of methods to implement}
    
4.  Update {add a file that needs to be updated with the new class (add class / name of class to a list, import it somewhere, etc.}
    

# Add the New Class

### Inherit from {base class}

We first need to define our class in {mention relevant file}, and inherit from {base class}

### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
â¬œ 1      {
â¬œ 2        "name": "stoke-weather",
â¬œ 3        "version": "0.1.0",
ðŸŸ© 4        "private": true,
ðŸŸ© 5        "dependencies": {
â¬œ 6          "@material-ui/core": "^4.12.3",
â¬œ 7          "@material-ui/icons": "^4.11.2",
â¬œ 8          "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.5.1",
```

## Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}

Every heloooo should define these at the class level:

*   {variable name}: {why we need to define variable name/what it does}
    
*   {another variable}: {why we need to define another variable/what it does}
    
*   ...
    

# Implement {method names to implement}

The goal of {first method} is to {explain what this method does}.

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new heloooo, we reference it in a few locations:

<br/>



<br/>

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new heloooo can be used:
