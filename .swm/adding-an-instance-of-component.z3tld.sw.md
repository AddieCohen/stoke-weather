Understanding helloComps and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about helloComps.

A helloComp is {add a high-level description of Components are and their role in the system}.

Some examples of helloComps are: {add examples here}

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of {Example Component (an instance of Component)} for this example.

{add a high-level description of Example Component}.

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from {base class} in {add a "/path" of a containing folder, and / or describe the file naming convention}
    
2.  Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}
    
3.  Implement {add names of methods to implement}
    
4.  Update {add a file that needs to be updated with the new class (add class / name of class to a list, import it somewhere, etc.}
    

# Add the New Class

### Inherit from

We first need to define our class in {mention relevant file}, and inherit from {base class}

### ðŸ“„ src/App.tsx
```tsx
â¬œ 8          return (
â¬œ 9              <div className="App">
â¬œ 10                 <header className="App-header">
ðŸŸ© 11                     <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
â¬œ 12                     <SearchBar/>
â¬œ 13                     <ComponentSwitch/>
â¬œ 14                 </header>
```

<br/>

## Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}

Every helloComp should define these at the class level:

*   {variable name}: {why we need to define variable name/what it does}
    
*   {another variable}: {why we need to define another variable/what it does}
    
*   ...

<br/>

# Implement {method names to implement}

The goal of {first method} is to {explain what this method does}.

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new helloComp, we reference it in a few locations:

<br/>



<br/>

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new helloComp can be used:
