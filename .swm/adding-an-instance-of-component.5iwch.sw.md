Understanding [[sym-link:(null)]]s and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about [[sym-link:(null)]]s.

A [[sym-link:(null)]] is [[sym-link:(null)]].

Some examples of [[sym-link:(null)]]s are: [[sym-link:(null)]]

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of [[sym-link:(null)]] for this example.

[[sym-link:(null)]].

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from [[sym-link:(null)]] in [[sym-link:(null)]]
    
2.  Define [[sym-link:(null)]]
    
3.  Implement [[sym-link:(null)]]
    
4.  Update [[sym-link:(null)]]
    

# Add the New Class

### Inherit from [[sym-link:(null)]]

We first need to define our class in [[sym-link:(null)]], and inherit from [[sym-link:(null)]]

<br/>

## Define [add class level variables / constants / types to define](#text-placeholder-id-exagy)

Every [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc) should define these at the class level:

*   [variable name](#text-placeholder-id-semhh): [why we need to define variable name/what it does](#text-placeholder-id-ndlwi)

*   [another variable](#text-placeholder-id-7u6mn): [why we need to define another variable/what it does](#text-placeholder-id-aqpkp)

*   ...

<br/>

# Implement [method names to implement](#text-placeholder-id-uke9s)

The goal of [first method](#text-placeholder-id-wmcbi) is to [explain what this method does](#text-placeholder-id-qmikw).

<br/>

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc), we reference it in a few locations:

<br/>

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc) can be used:
